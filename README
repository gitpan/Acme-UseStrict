NAME
    Acme::UseStrict - use strict constantly

SYNOPSIS
      use Acme::UseStrict;
      # not in strict mode
  
      sub foo {
        "use strict";
        # in strict mode here
      }
  
      sub bar {
        no Acme::UseStrict;
        "use strict";
        # not in strict mode
      }

DESCRIPTION
    ECMAScript 5.1 (i.e. Javascript) introduces a "strict mode" similar in
    spirit to Perl's strict mode. Usually you enable Perl's strict mode like
    this:

     use strict;

    But in ECMAScript it must be a quoted string:

     "use strict";

    It is received wisdom that Perl has an ugly syntax, so it naturally
    follows that any change to make Perl's syntax closer to Javascript will be
    welcome.

    This module allows you use use strict by simply including the string
    constant "use strict" anywhere in a scope.

     sub do_stuff {
       warn "use strict";
       *{"do_more_stuff"} = sub { }; # dies because of strict refs.
     }

  import
    But what if you'd rather have a different trigger to enable strict mode?
    Yes, that can be done:

     use Acme::UseStrict 'complain';
 
     sub do_stuff {
       my $foo = { complain => 'lots' };
       *{"do_more_stuff"} = sub { }; # dies because of strict refs.
     }

    You can even provide a regular expression:

     use Acme::UseStrict qr/^(complain|whine|moan|grumble)$/i;

    Or an list of values:

     use Acme::UseStrict [qw/complain whine moan grumble/];

    Or basically anything that works as a right-hand-side with the smart match
    operator.

  unimport
    You can disable this module for a lexical scope using:

     no Acme::UseStrict;

  in_effect
    You can check if this module is enabled:

     warn Acme::UseStrict::in_effect()
       ? 'mind your language'
       : 'curse freely';

    Note that this checks if this module is enabled; not if strict is enabled.
